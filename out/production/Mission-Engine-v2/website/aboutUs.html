							<h2>Stefan</h2>
							<p class="title">Co-Founder and Developer</p>
							<p>Hello, my name is Stefan and I’m the author of the ForceVector and FBDView classes. I’m an aspiring computer engineer, which shows why this project of a physics simulator interests me. I have had an eventful time working in The Bohring Company and hope that our Mission Engine will be used by many physics students.</p>

							<p>Hi, I’m a Jagrit and I programmed the MotionView and ObjectMotion classes for the Mission Engine. Coffee and Rock and Roll are what gets me through the day. I hope you enjoy the first product that has been launched by the Bohring Company.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</p>
